  description = <<-EOT
  key - Name of the SAN Connectivity Policy.
  * description - Description to Assign to the Policy.
  * tags - List of Key/Value Pairs to Assign as Attributes to the Policy.
  * target_platform - The platform for which the server profile is applicable. It can either be:
    - FIAttached (Default) - A Server attached to a Intersight Managed Domain.
    - Standalone - a server that is operating independently
  * vhba_placement_mode - The mode used for placement of vNICs on network adapters. It can either be Auto or Custom.
    - auto - The placement of the vNICs / vHBAs on network adapters is automatically determined by the system.
    - custom (Default) - The placement of the vNICs / vHBAs on network adapters is manually chosen by the user.
  * wwnn_allocation_type - Type of allocation selected to assign a WWNN address for the server node.
    - POOL (Default) - The user selects a pool from which the mac/wwn address will be leased for the Virtual Interface.
    - STATIC - The user assigns a static mac/wwn address for the Virtual Interface.
  * wwnn_pool - WWNN Pool to Assign to the Policy.
  * wwnn_static_address - The WWNN address for the server node must be in hexadecimal format xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.Allowed ranges are 20:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 to 20:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF or from 50:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 to 5F:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.To ensure uniqueness of WWN's in the SAN fabric, you are strongly encouraged to use the WWN prefix - 20:00:00:25:B5:xx:xx:xx.
  * vhbas - List of vHBAs to add to the SAN Connectivity Policy.
    - fibre_channel_adapter_policy - The Name of the Fibre Channel Adapter Policy to Assign to the vHBA.
    - fibre_channel_network_policy - The Name of the Fibre Channel Network Policy to Assign to the vHBA.
    - fibre_channel_qos_policy - The Name of the Fibre Channel QoS Policy to Assign to the vHBA.
    - name - Name of the virtual fibre channel interface.
    - persistent_lun_bindings - Default is false.  Enables retention of LUN ID associations in memory until they are manually cleared.
    - placement_pci_link - Default is 0.  The PCI Link used as transport for the virtual interface. All VIC adapters have a single PCI link except VIC 1385 which has two.
    - placement_pci_order - Default is 0.  The order in which the virtual interface is brought up. The order assigned to an interface should be unique for all the Ethernet and Fibre-Channel interfaces on each PCI link on a VIC adapter. The maximum value of PCI order is limited by the number of virtual interfaces (Ethernet and Fibre-Channel) on each PCI link on a VIC adapter. All VIC adapters have a single PCI link except VIC 1385 which has two.
    - placement_slot_id - Default is MLOM.  PCIe Slot where the VIC adapter is installed. Supported values are (1-15) and MLOM.
    - placement_switch_id - The fabric port to which the vNICs will be associated.
      1. A - Fabric A of the FI cluster.
      2. B - Fabric B of the FI cluster.
      3. None (Default) - Fabric Id is not set to either A or B for the standalone case where the server is not connected to Fabric Interconnects. The value 'None' should be used.
    - placement_uplink_port - Default is 0.  Adapter port on which the virtual interface will be created.  This attribute is for Standalone Servers Only.
    - vhba_type - VHBA Type configuration for SAN Connectivity Policy. This configuration is supported only on Cisco VIC 14XX series and higher series of adapters.
      1. fc-initiator (Default) - The default value set for vHBA Type Configuration. Fc-initiator specifies vHBA as a consumer of storage. Enables SCSI commands to transfer data and status information between host and target storage systems.
      2. fc-nvme-initiator - Fc-nvme-initiator specifies vHBA as a consumer of storage. Enables NVMe-based message commands to transfer data and status information between host and target storage systems.
      3. fc-nvme-target - Fc-nvme-target specifies vHBA as a provider of storage volumes to initiators. Enables NVMe-based message commands to transfer data and status information between host and target storage systems. Currently tech-preview, only enabled with an asynchronous driver.
      4. fc-target - Fc-target specifies vHBA as a provider of storage volumes to initiators. Enables SCSI commands to transfer data and status information between host and target storage systems. fc-target is enabled only with an asynchronous driver.
    - wwpn_allocation_type -  Type of allocation selected to assign a WWPN address to the vhba.
      1. POOL - The user selects a pool from which the mac/wwn address will be leased for the Virtual Interface.
      2. STATIC - The user assigns a static mac/wwn address for the Virtual Interface.
    - wwpn_static_address -  The WWPN address must be in hexadecimal format xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.  Allowed ranges are 20:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 to 20:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF or from 50:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 to 5F:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.  To ensure uniqueness of WWN's in the SAN fabric, you are strongly encouraged to use the WWN prefix - 20:00:00:25:B5:xx:xx:xx.
