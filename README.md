# Intersight IaC Wizard

[![published](https://static.production.devnetcloud.com/codeexchange/assets/images/devnet-published.svg)](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/repo/scotttyso/intersight_iac)

## Updates/News - Archiving Repository

11-18-2023
* Renaming repository to make it more relevant to all the use cases covered
* New Repository [intersight-tools](https://github.com/scotttyso/intersight-tools)
* Please start using new repository

11-30-2022
* Changing Script output from HCL to YAML
* Remove requirements for Go Compiler
* Remove requirements for the HCL2JSON Tool - No longer utilized
* Added Support for Importing Existing YAML Files to be consumed by Script
* Added FC Zone Policy

09-11-2022
* Renamed main.py to ezimm.py to allow execution from remote directory

03-08-2022
* Added Windows Support

* IMPORTANT - There is currently a bug with Policy Buckets for UCS Domain Profiles.  That is the only reason ucs_domain_profiles are not in the same folder as chassis and servers.  When this is fixed the ucs_domain_profiles folder will be merged with the profiles folder.  Because of this limitation at this time make sure to create a seperate policy for Domains of the following types:

- network_connectivity_policies - If Using Standalone Server Policies
- ntp_policies - If Using Standalone Server Policies
- snmp_policies
- syslog_policies

### Clone this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scotttyso/intersight_iac
cd intersight_iac
```

- Install the Requirements File

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Terraform Requirements

The script utilizes features introduced in 1.3.0 of Terraform.  So we need 1.3.0 or preferrably >1.3.0

- Download Here [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 
- For Windows Make sure it is in a Directory that is in the system path.

### Terraform Modules and Providers

This script will utilize the Intersight Terraform Provider and two modules built off of the Intersight Provider.

- [Intersight Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/intersight/latest)
- [Easy IMM Comprehensive Example](https://github.com/terraform-cisco-modules/easy-imm-comprehensive-example)

## Running the Wizard

- It is recommend to add the following secure variables to your environment before running the script

- Linux

```bash
## Intersight Variables
export TF_VAR_apikey="<your_intersight_api_key>"
export TF_VAR_secretkey=`cat ~/Downloads/SecretKey.txt` 
# The above example is based on the key being in your Downloads folder.  Correct for your environment.

## Terraform Cloud Variables
export TF_VAR_terraform_cloud_token="<your_terraform_cloud_token>"
```

- Windows - Plugin your API Keys and the File Location of the Intersight Secret Key.

```powershell
## Powershell Intersight Variables
$env:TF_VAR_apikey="<your_intersight_api_key>"
$env:TF_VAR_secretkey="$HOME\Downloads\SecretKey.txt"
# The above example is based on the key being in your Downloads folder.  Correct for your environment.

## Powershell Terraform Cloud Variables
$env:TF_VAR_terraform_cloud_token="<your_terraform_cloud_token>"
```

### Running the Wizard for Brownfield Migration with the IMM Transition Tool
- Running the wizard to use a configuration migrated from UCS Manager using the IMM Transition Tool

```bash
./ezimm.py -j {json_file_name.json}
```

### Running the Wizard for Greenfield Deployment
- Running the Wizard to generate IaC through a Question and Answer Wizard

```bash
./ezimm.py
```

## Wizard Help Menu

```bash
./ezimm.py -h

Intersight Easy IMM Deployment Module

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a API_KEY_ID, --api-key-id API_KEY_ID
                        The Intersight API client key id for HTTP signature scheme
  -s API_KEY_FILE, --api-key-file API_KEY_FILE
                        Name of file containing The Intersight secret key for the HTTP signature scheme
  --api-key-v3          Use New API client (v3) key
  -d DIR, --dir DIR     The Directory to Publish the Terraform Files to.
  -i, --ignore-tls      Ignore TLS server-side certificate verification
  -j JSON_FILE, --json_file JSON_FILE
                        The IMM Transition Tool JSON Dump File to Convert to HCL.
  -u URL, --url URL     The Intersight root URL for the API endpoint. The default is https://intersight.com
```

## Terraform Plan and Apply

After the Script has generated the Repository and downloaded the resources from the Easy IMM Comprehensive Example, the data will need to be pushed to Intersight using Terraform Cloud.

## Disclaimer

This code is provided as is.  No warranty, support, or guarantee is provided with this.  But in typical github fashion there is the opportunity to collaborate and share Bug's/Feedback/PR Requests.

## Synopsis

The purpose of this Python Tool is to deploy Policy/Profiles to Intersight using Infastructure as Code with Terraform.  The Wizard is a step for users to create and better understand how to utilize Terraform for managing infrastrudture.

The goal of this module is to begin to familiarize you with Terraform through the following steps:  

1. Begin to familiarize users with Terraform format and variable creation.  
2. Once a user feels conformatable with the auto generated files, Transition towards writing your own modules to consume.
3. And lastly build your confidence to write your own code as well.  

The wizard will show after each section what the YAML Data being generated will look like.  In the Heading for each section it will point you to the directly and file where the code will be created.  And lastly, publish the code to Terraform Cloud and when you are ready.

### Intersight Profiles and Templates

This set of modules support creating the following Profile Types:

To sum this up... the goal is to deploy the infrastructure using Terraform through an easy to consume wizard.
